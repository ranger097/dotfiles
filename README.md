Complete Copy of My Nixos System
As I learn more about Nixos and Linux, I will continue to share as much as possible.
There are scripts i have written that enable and disable waybar, update the configs, etc.
This repo is a collection of all configs i was able to build thus far (well at least most of the usable stuff).

This screenshot is how the current system looks from within a terminal (Ghostty).
Here you can see there are several distrobox containers for learning/mastering varius langauges (I will write a script to set this up soon).
Also there is a Top and Bottom Waybar config featuring clickable applications that i use frequently (You can easily change these, also i plan on adding more).
Lastly i have Rofi and Wlogout installed for fast application launching and easy shutdowns and reboots.
Ive tried to keep the system lightweight and simple.
The Repo is made for me to be able to share between my other computers and some aspects of the system with friends.
Feel free to enjoy and share this setup however you want.
